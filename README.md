# DataPlotter v1.0.0
## Web application for time series visualization
- web application for my Bachelor thesis
- based on D3.js, Express.js and MongoDB
### Abstract
Goal of this project is to create a tool that visualizes time series
data, or more accurately a tool that processes csv files containing
data that has changed over time, and show them clearly to a user.

Whole web application was made as a solution. This web appli-
cation is built on JavaScript and mainly uses D3.js library. For

needs of this project backend server application was made, so data
manipulation is easier and so whole project can store data in long
term database. Whole application then provides easy yet effective

tools to manipulate data, display them in plots and it also provi-
des tools that work with plots themself, that are mostly missing in

competitionâ€™s solutions.
